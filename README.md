This utility allows for the conversion of a P2G archive into an mp4 video file.
Two methods of usage for converter.py:
1 - >python converter.py target_directory
where target directory is an unziped P2G archive
2 - >python converter.py
In usage 2, a prompt will allow the user to browse for the zip file

Script is only designed for use on Mac OS X.

OPEN_ME is essentially a shortcut for method 2.
